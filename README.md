# HAR-Dataset

Collected by placing IMU Sensor at right side of waist using a belt.

Dataset consists of following columns in order-

Ax_mean, Ay_mean, Az-mean, Gx_mean, Gy_mean, Gz_mean, Ax_rms, Ay_rms, Az_rms, Gx_rms, Gy_rms, Gz_rms

where - 

Ai_mean : Mean of 10 raw accelerometer readings along i axis collected at sampling rate of 40 ms.

Ai_rms : Root Mean Square average of 10 raw accelerometer readings along i axis collected at sampling rate of 40 ms.

Ai_mean : Mean of 10 raw gyroscope readings along i axis collected at sampling rate of 40 ms.

Ai_rms : Root Mean Square average of 10 raw gyroscope readings along i axis collected at sampling rate of 40 ms.
